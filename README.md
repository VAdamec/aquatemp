# aquatemp

Bash scripts for integration of AquaTemp wifi module to Home Assistant using mqtt autodiscovery

requirement of mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub and jq
(mosquitto-clients jq)

first run

1.	edit settings file for your needs
2.	./heatpump install
3. ~~add control.sh and status.sh to systemd
	(you could use the script "setup_systemd install" to add and enable the service "ubuntu"
	the service name will be aquatemp_control and aquatemp_status)~~

uninstall

1.	./heatpump uninstall (removes the entities from Home Assistant)
2.	remove control.sh and status.sh from systemd
	~~(you could use the script "setup_systemd uninstall" to remove and disable the service "ubuntu")~~


Poll intervall for the app is 20s, so i recommend to not set this to lower value than 20s 

# Warmlink update
- API calls from iOS app wireshark data, object camelcased, different auth URI, ...
- run in term/ssh on HASS (need to be rerun if restarted)
    ```shell
	 nohup ./status.sh &
	 nohup ./control.sh &
	```
  - status.sh read data from cloud and store them in MQTT, calling heatpump script
  - control.sh read MQTT and change temp/mode when changed, calling heatpump script with specific commands

## TODO
- Some parameters doesn't exists, there are others which are not covered yet
 - ~~No idea about password hash mechanism yes - hash taken from wireshark and use as a password in settings~~
	- ```echo -n "YOURPASSWORD" | openssl dgst -md5 | awk '{print $2}'```
- ~~Changing temperature via shell script - see `HASS_script_only.md`~~
- ~~Busybox grep is not working properly/not GNU~~
  - replaced by perl regexp
